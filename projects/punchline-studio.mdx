# Punchline Studio

## Overview

Punchline Studio helps comedians turn rough jokes into punchy, stage ready material.  
It rewrites jokes with clearer structure and adds delivery notes, then uses ElevenLabs voices so comics can hear different styles of performance on demand.

## Key Features

- Joke Rewrite: Tightens premises and punchlines while preserving the comic's voice
- Delivery Notes: Adds timing, emphasis, and emotion cues for performance
- Voice Playback: Uses ElevenLabs voices so you can audition different styles
- History: Save, compare, and revisit past rewrites and takes

## How It Works

Punchline Studio connects several components:

- Cerebras or LLM backend handles joke rewriting and delivery note generation
- ElevenLabs API generates performance audio for each take
- The frontend lets comics paste a bit, select a delivery style, trigger rewrite, and play back the AI performance
- History view stores multiple versions so comics can compare and iterate

## Technologies Used

- ElevenLabs API (text to speech and voice styles)
- Cerebras or other LLM backend for joke rewriting
- Raindrop platform for hosting and workflow
- Frontend framework of your choice (for example Next.js or React)
- Any additional tooling used for storage, auth, or deployment
